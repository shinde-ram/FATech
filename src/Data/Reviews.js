      "Something I really appreciate about institute is aptitude behaviour for problem-soleving. I think its a great job when you ran the all-hands Projects. It showed that team building and capable of getting people to work together and communicate effectively. I admire my seniors for their co-ordinating ability.One of most impactful thing was how projects were handled and ability to providing many more projects to avoid hustle for our future perspective. Institute showed the power of user testing in shaping a feature roadmap. I'd love to see you do more of in this field. For HR department-I can see you're positively impacting your office and managing the required thing to us without getting irritated. People seem happy to have you in office",
